this works like the detect EL script; just do:

    main.py run all [folder_name]

    eg.

    main.py run all Transcripts


It will create a text_output.txt and csv_output.csv files. It does so by overwriting, so if you already have those files from a previous run then be sure to move them to a different directory for saving. the text_output.txt has the details about what was actually detected.
